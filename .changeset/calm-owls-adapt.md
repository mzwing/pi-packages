feat: adapt to Pi 1.0, accept @gotgenes/pi-permission-system v37 – v39, and harden pi-permission-auto-review with lessons from @czottmann/pi-automode and upstream Codex

pi-model-info now keeps a model's `samplingParamsByThinkingLevel`, new in Pi 1.0.2, when it re-registers a provider's models, instead of dropping it.

The `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system` peer range moves to v37 – v39, which require Pi 1.0. Their breaking changes gate Pi's built-in MCP tools on the `mcp` surface and narrow the Pi infrastructure read bypass, leaving the authorizer surface unchanged.

pi-permission-auto-review reads a project's `.pi/extensions/pi-permission-auto-review/config.json` only once Pi trusts the project, as pi-permission-system does with its own project config, so an untrusted repository cannot swap in a policy that approves everything. `/permission-auto-review` refuses to edit an untrusted project's config, and `show` marks it as ignored.

The reviewer sees the complete input of the tool call that raised the ask instead of pi-permission-system's preview, and the request is no longer truncated: an action too large for the reviewer model defers to the human prompt as `input-budget-exceeded`. Reviews use their own `auto-review:<session id>` session key, so they stop resetting the main conversation's Codex WebSocket continuation.

Interrupting the turn cancels a running review at once and denies the ask, since deferring would open the prompt the user just escaped. A denial carries Codex's instruction against working around it, a malformed reply is retried within the review's budget, the reviewer's output is no longer capped at 1,000 tokens, and every decision logs the tokens it used. The footer shows whether the reviewer is registered and how many asks it allowed, denied or deferred.
