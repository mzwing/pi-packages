## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`76a551a`](https://github.com/mzwing/pi-packages/commit/76a551a3eb5ba47ef5137407f8a15b1c36f9eab1) Thanks [@mzwing](https://github.com/mzwing)! - feat: adapt to Pi 0.86 and @gotgenes/pi-permission-system v33, reconcile the bundled Guardian policy
  
  The Pi peer range moves to `^0.86.0`. 0.86 replaces the pi-ai provider stream input with a normalized `TranscriptContext` and restricts `ToolCall.arguments` and `ToolResultMessage.details` to JSON values, so these packages are built and tested against that line only.
  
  `Provider.streamSimple()` no longer accepts a system prompt, so pi-permission-auto-review streams reviews through `ModelRegistry.streamSimple()` instead. That facade takes the prompt directly and resolves request-time authentication, so the reviewer no longer fetches an API key itself: an unusable Codex login now logs `provider-error` rather than the removed `auth-unresolved` category, and still defers to the human prompt. Its `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system` peer range narrows to v33, the only line tested against Pi 0.86 — that release's breaking changes are internal MCP rule matching, leaving the authorizer surface unchanged from v32.
  
  The bundled Guardian policy is reconciled against openai/codex@a8c36ca6, which moved `policy_template.md` and `policy.md` from `codex-rs/core/assets/guardian` to `codex-rs/prompts/templates/guardian` (openai/codex#46026). Both files are byte-identical across the move, so the adapted policy text is unchanged; only the tracked directory and the pinned revision recorded in `POLICY_REVISION` move.
